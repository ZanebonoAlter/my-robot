- [x] 3.3 Move `docs/guides/tagging-flow.md`, `docs/guides/topic-graph.md` → split to `docs/ai-features/` and `docs/topic-graph/`
- [x] 3.4 Move `docs/guides/frontend-features.md` → `docs/development/frontend-features.md`
- [x] 3.5 Move `docs/guides/configuration.md`, `docs/guides/deployment.md`, `docs/guides/testing.md` → `docs/system/` or `docs/development/`
- [x] 3.6 Move `docs/architecture/frontend.md`, `docs/architecture/frontend-components.md` → `docs/development/frontend-architecture.md`
- [x] 3.7 Move `docs/architecture/backend-go.md`, `docs/architecture/backend-runtime.md`, `docs/architecture/data-flow.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md` → `docs/system/architecture/`
- [x] 3.8 Move `docs/architecture/tracing.md` → `docs/system/tracing.md`
- [x] 3.9 Move `docs/architecture/tag-cleanup-redesign.md` → `docs/topic-graph/tag-cleanup-design.md`

## 4. Core Migration - Operations & Experience

- [x] 4.1 Move `docs/operations/database.md`, `docs/operations/postgres-migration.md` → `docs/system/database-operations.md`
- [x] 4.2 Move `docs/operations/development.md` → `docs/development/operations.md`
- [x] 4.3 Move `docs/operations/troubleshooting.md` → `docs/system/troubleshooting.md`
- [x] 4.4 Move `docs/experience/ENCODING_SAFETY.md` → `docs/development/encoding-safety.md`
- [x] 4.5 Move `docs/experience/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` → `docs/development/lessons-learned.md`
- [x] 4.6 Move `docs/database/DATABASE_FIELDS.md` → `docs/system/database-schema.md`

## 5. Index & Cross-Reference Creation

- [x] 5.1 Create `docs/README.md` with:
  - Overview of new organization
  - Directory listing with descriptions
  - "Moved from..." mapping table for common lookups
- [x] 5.2 Create `docs/plans/README.md` with chronological index of all plan documents
- [x] 5.3 Add per-feature index files if a feature has 3+ documents (optional)

## 6. Cleanup & Verification

- [x] 6.1 Delete old empty directories (`docs/api/`, `docs/architecture/`, `docs/database/`, `docs/experience/`, `docs/guides/`, `docs/operations/`)
- [x] 6.2 Update any hardcoded paths in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, or other repo files
- [x] 6.3 Verify no broken internal links within moved documentation (spot check)
- [x] 6.4 Run `git status` to confirm all moves are tracked as renames
- [ ] 6.5 Commit with message: `docs: reorganize documentation by functional domain`
